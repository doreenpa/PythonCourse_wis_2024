*My name is Doreen and I’m a PhD student at Prof. Michael Neeman's lab.
*As part of my project, I study Transglutaminase 2 (TG2) activity in the mouse placenta upon different pregnancy pathologies.
*TG2 regulates its substrate activity by generating a post-translation modification – a covalent bond of glutamine-lysine inside *a protein and between two proteins.
